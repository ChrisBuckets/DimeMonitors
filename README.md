# DimeMonitors

## General Info
Dime Monitors is a monitoring tool for the NBA Topshot NFT marketplace. The program listens for specific events such as new listings and sales on Flow's mainnet. Whenever someone
lists an NFT on NBA Topshot's website it is able to use the blockchain events to identify the listing before it is shown on their website, so before the average person
using their marketplace even knows the NFT is for sale, the program is already comparing the listing to thousands of previous sales from it's database to see if the
NFT was listed cheaper then usual and providing the link for it's users to purchase.

Dime Monitors saves every sale that happens to a database and has millions of sales worth of data to get the most accurate price estimate for any
NFT that is listed on NBA Topshot.

## Real World Example

A Lebron James NFT was listed for $184 and after searching through the database for that same type of NFT's average price it was able to identify that the average
price is $351, this is a 48% difference so there is a lot of profit for the user to make. The program grabs the link of the NFT and posts it in the discord
in only 700 ms.

If an average person on the website is trying to wait for this card to come up, there is no way they'd be able to compete with this program.

A small example of a user purchasing an NFT for $20, and selling it for four times that amount in the same hour.

## Summary
I've made a lot of projects over the years but this is the one I'm most proud of. It made profit for my friends and I and it had demand within the NBA Topshot Community
and I was able to sell it as a service to people. I've always wanted to code something that people wanted and this is one of the things that generated the most interest.
